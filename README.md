# GOLA

Simple Web app framework for go lang

The Gola framework is based on Fiber, godotenv, and mongo library
It's very opinionated on how code should be structured

To create a new project
```bash
gola init [project_name]
```

to add new controller in existing project

```bash
gola controller [controller_name]
```

to run the project

```bash
gola run
```

gola build
```
